# Fall 2022 CS170 Group Project

NP-Hard optimization challenge. 

Given n penguins, any 2 penguins (nodes) u and v have a dispute (edge weight) between them. The goal is to design an algorithm that finds the optimal assignment of k tournament teams, such that the total dispute among each team is minimized. 

## Requirements
`python >= 3.6` is needed for `starter.py`, which contains a handful of utility functions, to run properly; it was, nevertheless, developed in python 3.9.  
Jupyter Notebook is required should you prefer using `main.ipynb`.
